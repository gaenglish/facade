# UNI Core

UNI's Core package is a library of types, models, and functions for building UI components for various platforms. 
The core system is focussed on establishing patterns that are most common in modern user interfaces while remaining framework-agnostic.
UNI Core can be used with React, Angular, Vue, and any TypeScript based system.

> **_NOTE:_**  UNI Core is currently in its development phase and should be considered experimental.
